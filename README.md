## Verify-Tech-Test

Solution to Verify - Technical test

In this repository, you will find the python notebook with which the technical test is solved and the JSON from which the information is extracted. In the notebook you will find the necessary functions to extract the information. Now, it must be clear that not all the functions are created to read the two JSON files, since these are two different ones and the information is distributed in a different way within the JSON.

To extract the information from the JSON files, you must first identify which file belongs to the CALLE 80 store and which belongs to VALLE DE LILI. Once this is done, it is only to execute the following functions:

-- get_info_calle80(JSON)
-- get_info_vallelili(JSON)
